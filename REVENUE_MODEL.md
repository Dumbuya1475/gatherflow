**Key Insight**: High profit margins (70-90%) because main costs are covered by payment fees!

---

## Pricing Philosophy

### **Simple & Transparent**
- **One flat rate**: 3.5% + NLE 3 per ticket
- No tiers, no hidden fees
- Same price for everyone
- Easy to calculate revenue

### **Organizer Chooses Who Pays**
Organizers can pass fees to buyers or absorb them:

**Option 1: Organizer Absorbs Fee**
- Buyer pays: NLE 100
- Organizer receives: NLE 93.50
- Platform gets: NLE 6.50

**Option 2: Buyer Pays Fee (Recommended)**
- Buyer pays: NLE 106.50
- Organizer receives: NLE 100 (full amount!)
- Platform gets: NLE 6.50

Most organizers choose Option 2 (buyer pays) because:
- ‚úÖ They receive 100% of advertised price
- ‚úÖ Industry standard (Eventbrite does this)
- ‚úÖ Transparent to buyers

---

## Fee Structure: Two Options

GatherFlow offers organizers flexibility in how platform fees are handled:

### **Option 1: Organizer Absorbs Fee (Deduct from Ticket)**

**Example:**
- Listed Ticket Price: SLE 100,000
- Platform Fee (3.5%): SLE 3,500
- **Buyer Pays**: SLE 100,000
- **Organizer Receives**: SLE 96,500
- **Platform Revenue**: SLE 3,500

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler buyer experience (one price)
- ‚úÖ Ticket price appears lower (more attractive)
- ‚úÖ No fee "sticker shock" for buyers
- ‚úÖ Buyer sees exactly what they pay upfront

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Organizer receives less than advertised price
- ‚ùå May need to price tickets higher to compensate
- ‚ùå Less transparent about platform costs

**Best For:**
- High-volume, low-price events (concerts, festivals)
- Events where price sensitivity is high
- Organizers who want to show competitive pricing

---

### **Option 2: Buyer Pays Fee (Add Fee on Top)**

**Example:**
- Listed Ticket Price: SLE 100,000
- Platform Fee (3.5%): SLE 3,500
- **Buyer Pays**: SLE 103,500
- **Organizer Receives**: SLE 100,000 (full amount)
- **Platform Revenue**: SLE 3,500

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Organizer receives 100% of advertised ticket price
- ‚úÖ Transparent - buyer sees exact fee breakdown
- ‚úÖ Industry standard (Eventbrite, Ticketmaster do this)
- ‚úÖ Organizer can set precise revenue goals

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Total checkout price higher than listed price
- ‚ùå May cause some cart abandonment
- ‚ùå Buyers may compare unfavorably to "all-in" pricing

**Best For:**
- Premium events (conferences, workshops)
- Professional organizers who know their margins
- Events where attendees expect service fees
- Higher-priced tickets (fee is smaller percentage of total)

---

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Option 1: Organizer Absorbs | Option 2: Buyer Pays |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Buyer Pays** | SLE 100,000 | SLE 103,500 |
| **Organizer Receives** | SLE 96,500 | SLE 100,000 |
| **Platform Revenue** | SLE 3,500 | SLE 3,500 |

### Monthly Revenue Simulation

Let's simulate 1 month of events with both fee models:

**Scenario: 100 events, 5,000 total tickets**
- Average ticket price: SLE 50,000
- Platform fee: 3.5% + SLE 300

#### Option 1 Simulation (Organizer Absorbs)

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total Ticket Revenue | SLE 250,000,000 |
| Platform Fees (3.5%) | SLE 8,750,000 |
| Fixed Fees (5,000 √ó SLE 300) | SLE 1,500,000 |
| **Total Platform Revenue** | **SLE 10,250,000** (~$1,025) |
| **Total to Organizers** | **SLE 239,750,000** (~$23,975) |
| **Buyer Pays (avg per ticket)** | **SLE 50,000** |

**Organizer receives**: 95.9% of ticket price

---

#### Option 2 Simulation (Buyer Pays)

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Listed Ticket Revenue | SLE 250,000,000 |
| Platform Fees (3.5%) | SLE 8,750,000 |
| Fixed Fees (5,000 √ó SLE 300) | SLE 1,500,000 |
| **Total Platform Revenue** | **SLE 10,250,000** (~$1,025) |
| **Total to Organizers** | **SLE 250,000,000** (~$25,000) |
| **Buyer Pays (avg per ticket)** | **SLE 52,050** |

**Organizer receives**: 100% of advertised price
**Buyer pays**: 4.1% more than listed price

---

### Real-World Example: 1,000 Ticket Event

**Event**: Music Festival
**Ticket Price**: SLE 75,000

#### Option 1: Organizer Absorbs
```
Listed Price: SLE 75,000
Buyer Pays: SLE 75,000
Platform Fee: (75,000 √ó 3.5%) + 300 = SLE 2,925
Organizer Gets: 75,000 - 2,925 = SLE 72,075 per ticket

√ó 1,000 tickets:
- Total Revenue from Buyers: SLE 75,000,000
- Total to Organizer: SLE 72,075,000
- Total to Platform: SLE 2,925,000
```

#### Option 2: Buyer Pays
```
Listed Price: SLE 75,000
Platform Fee: (75,000 √ó 3.5%) + 300 = SLE 2,925
Buyer Pays: 75,000 + 2,925 = SLE 77,925
Organizer Gets: SLE 75,000 per ticket

√ó 1,000 tickets:
- Total Revenue from Buyers: SLE 77,925,000
- Total to Organizer: SLE 75,000,000
- Total to Platform: SLE 2,925,000
```

**Impact:**
- Organizer makes **SLE 2,925,000 MORE** with Option 2
- Each buyer pays **SLE 2,925 MORE** with Option 2
- Platform revenue is **THE SAME** either way

---

### Recommended Implementation

**Default**: Option 2 (Buyer Pays Fee) ‚úÖ

**Reasoning:**
1. Industry standard - buyers expect service fees
2. Organizers get 100% of advertised revenue
3. More transparent and builds trust
4. Aligns with international platforms (Eventbrite, Ticketmaster)
5. Easier for organizers to calculate ROI

**But allow organizers to toggle this per event**

**In Event Creation Form:**
```typescript
‚ñ° Pass platform fees to buyers (recommended)
  
  If checked: Buyers pay listed price + 3.5% + SLE 300
  If unchecked: You receive listed price - 3.5% - SLE 300
  
  [See pricing calculator]
```

---

### Pricing Calculator Widget

Show organizers in real-time what they'll receive:

**Example Display:**
```
Ticket Price: SLE 50,000
Expected Sales: 500 tickets

‚ñ° Pass fees to buyers

With fee passed to buyers:
  Buyer pays: SLE 52,050 per ticket
  You receive: SLE 50,000 per ticket
  Total payout: SLE 25,000,000

Without passing fees:
  Buyer pays: SLE 50,000 per ticket
  You receive: SLE 48,200 per ticket
  Total payout: SLE 24,100,000
  
Difference: SLE 900,000 less revenue
```

This transparency helps organizers make informed decisions!
