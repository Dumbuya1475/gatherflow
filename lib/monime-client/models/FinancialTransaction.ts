/**
 * A **Financial Transaction** represents a movement of funds that affects a Financial Account, either as a **credit** (inflow) or a **debit** (outflow).
 * Every transaction adjusts the balance of an account and provides a full audit trail of how money moves within Monime.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### Use Cases
 *
 * - **Customer Payment Recording**
 * A user pays SLE 500 into your platform via Mobile Money.
 * *Result*: A **credit transaction** is posted to a financial account of the space; this transaction is linked to a **Payment** created from the originating **Payment Code**.
 *
 * - **Fee Deduction**
 * A SLE 50 fee is charged for a payout of SLE 1,000.
 * *Result*:
 * - A **debit transaction** of SLE 1,000 from the payout account.
 * - A **debit transaction** of SLE 50 from the payout account.
 *
 * - **Internal Transfer**
 * Moving SLE 10,000 from a Settlement Account to a Disbursement Float.
 * *Result*:
 * - A **debit transaction** on the Settlement Account.
 * - A **credit transaction** on the Disbursement Float Account.
 *
 * - **Refund or Reversal**
 * If a payment is refunded, a corresponding **debit transaction** reduces the merchantâ€™s balance.
 * *Result*: The audit trail shows both the original credit and the refund debit, linked together.
