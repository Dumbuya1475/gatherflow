Overview of Monime Checkout Sessions and how to use them

A Checkout Session is a short-lived object that creates a hosted checkout page for collecting payments on your behalf. Use it to accept payments quickly without building your own payment UI. You control what the customer is paying for, the amount, allowed payment methods, and where to return the customer after payment.
​
When to use Checkout Session
You want a fast, secure way to accept payments with minimal UI work
You need a hosted page that supports multiple payment methods out-of-the-box
You want Monime to handle payment state, redirection, and receipt UI
​
How it works
1
Create a Checkout Session (server)

Your server calls the API to create a session with amount, currency, and options.
2
Redirect customer

Redirect the customer to the hosted checkout URL returned in the session.
3
Customer pays

The customer completes payment on Monime’s secure page.
4
Webhook + Return URL

Receive payment status via webhook and/or redirect back to your site.

A Checkout Session represents a Monime-hosted payment flow where customers complete purchases for a defined set of items.

It is designed for e-commerce and embedded payment scenarios where merchants want a simple, secure way to accept payments across multiple channels without building the payment UI themselves.

Unlike direct API-based payments, a Checkout Session aggregates multiple payment methods — such as Mobile Money, Card, and Bank Transfers — and presents them in a unified checkout experience.

Use Cases
E-Commerce Cart Checkout

A customer selects items in a cart. The merchant creates a Hosted Checkout Session, and Monime presents Mobile Money, Card, and Bank options in one unified flow.

Embedded SaaS Billing

A SaaS platform embeds a Hosted Checkout Session to bill users. Customers pick their preferred channel (Card, MoMo, Bank), and once payment is confirmed, the SaaS receives checkout_session.completed.

QR or Link-Based Payment

Merchants generate a checkout session link or QR code. Customers open the hosted page and choose any available payment method.

Fallback Across Methods

If a user’s card payment fails, they can seamlessly retry with Mobile Money — all within the same checkout session.
